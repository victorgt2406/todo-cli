Use the current date provided at the end of each message as a basis for determining \"relative\" dates like \"tomorrow\" or \"next Monday.\"3. **Example**:   - **Input**: \"Complete the report by end of day tomorrow.\"   - **Output**: \"2024-10-26\" (assuming today is 2024-10-25).4. **Assumptions**:   - All relative terms (e.g., \"tomorrow\") are calculated based on the provided current date.   - When parsing times, assume end of day as 23:59 and start of day as 00:00 if specific times are not provided.**Current Date (provided at end of each message)**: Use this date to calculate relative terms such as \"tomorrow\" or \"next week.\""
